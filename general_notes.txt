## Pure components

One of the concepts of React, is that it assumus we always create pure
components (pure functions).

Keep components pure. A component should return the same JSX for the same input,
always.

A pure component don't modify an object or a variable that existed before
rendering, only variables declared inside the component itself, or side
effects, as events for example.

Each component should render JSX on their own, they should be independent.

As event handler don't run during rendering they don't need to be pure.

## Adding Interactivity

Hooks are special functions that allows you to use special React features,
one of those features is useState hook with provides states.

The rendering process in React:

1. Triggering a render
2. Rendering the component
3. Commiting to the DOM
